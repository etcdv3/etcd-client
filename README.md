# etcdv3

[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

An [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) v3 API client for Rust.
It provides asynchronous client backed by [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).

## Features

- etcd API v3
- asynchronous

## Supported APIs

- [x] KV
- [x] Watch
- [ ] Lease
- [ ] Cluster
- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Auth
- [ ] Election
- [ ] Lock

## Usage

```Rust
use ectdv3::*;

let mut client = Client::connect(["localhost:2379"]).await?;
// put kv
client.put("foo", "bar", None).await?;
// get kv
let resp = client.get("foo", None).await?;
if let Some(kv) = resp.kvs().first() {
    println!("Get kv: {{{}: {}}}", kv.key_str()?, kv.value_str()?);
}
```

## Examples

Examples can be found in [`examples`](./examples).

## Test

We test this library using etcd 3.4.

Notes that we use a fixed `etcd` server URI (localhost:2379) to connect to etcd server.

## Rust version requirements

`etcdv3` works on rust `1.39` and above as it requires support for the `async_await`
feature.
