//! An [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) v3 API client for Rust.
//! It provides asynchronous client backed by [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).
//!
//! # Supported APIs
//!
//! - KV
//! - Watch
//! - Lease
//! - Auth
//! - Maintenance
//! - Cluster
//! - Lock
//! - Election
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! etcd-client = "0.7"
//! tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
//! ```
//!
//! To get started using `etcd-client`:
//!
//! ```Rust
//! use etcd_client::{Client, Error};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let mut client = Client::connect(["localhost:2379"], None).await?;
//!     // put kv
//!     client.put("foo", "bar", None).await?;
//!     // get kv
//!     let resp = client.get("foo", None).await?;
//!     if let Some(kv) = resp.kvs().first() {
//!         println!("Get kv: {{{}: {}}}", kv.key_str()?, kv.value_str()?);
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Examples can be found in [`etcd-client/examples`](https://github.com/etcdv3/etcd-client/tree/master/examples).
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! - `tls`: Enables the `rustls`-based TLS connection. Not
//! enabled by default.
//! - `tls-roots`: Adds system trust roots to `rustls`-based TLS connection using the
//! `rustls-native-certs` crate. Not enabled by default.
//! - `pub-response-field`: Exposes structs used to create regular `etcd-client` responses
//! including internal protobuf representations. Useful for mocking. Not enabled by default.
